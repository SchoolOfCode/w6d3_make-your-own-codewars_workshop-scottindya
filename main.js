//A man wants to make a million pounds, starts with Â£n
//Can work at his first job until doubles his current balance - they pay 10% of starting balance per day (i.e n*0.1)
//Second job until he triples current balance etc. - second job will pay 20% of his starting balance per day (i.e. n*0.2)
//
//he will work only full days, and only until he makes his million, not a day longer.
//Output should be how many different jobs he needs if he starts with n 

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:


//while dollarsInTheBank < 1000000



function makeAMillion(startingBalance,targetMultiplier){
    
let dollarsInTheBank = startingBalance;
while(dollarsInTheBank<1000000){


let salaryMultiplier = 0.1;

let target = startingBalance*targetMultiplier;
