//A man wants to make a million pounds, starts with Â£n
//Can work at his first job until doubles his current balance - they pay 10% of his initial starting balance per day (i.e n*0.1)
//Second job until he triples current balance etc. - second job will pay 20% of his initial starting balance per day (i.e. n*0.2)
//
//he will work only full days, and only until he makes his million, not a day longer.
//Output should be how many days it will take hime to make his million

//ðŸ‘‰ Write your tests below here:

import { makeAMillion } from "./main";

  const expected = 15816;
  const n = 100;
  const actual = makeAMillion(n);
